# Introduction

The priest is a video game that has been created during the 2016 Global Game Jam, at Toulouse, France.
Global game jam is a worldwide event where participants have to create a videogame in 48 hours. The main word of the jam was "believe", so we had to create a game with this "topic".
Following this event, we participated at a European competition (Yourope game challenge) by improving this game.
